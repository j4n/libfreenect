Description: library for accessing Kinect device
 libfreenect is a cross-platform library that provides the necessary interfaces
 to activate, initialize, and communicate data with the Kinect hardware.
 Currently, the library supports access to RGB and depth video streams, motors,
 accelerometer and LED and provide binding in different languages (C++,
 Python...)
 .
 This library is the low level component of the OpenKinect project which is an
 open community of people interested in making use of the Xbox Kinect hardware
 with PCs and other devices.
 .
 This package contains the shared library of libfreenect.
